# Efficient Portfolio Tool

Efficient Portfolio Tool is a [Streamlit ](https://streamlit.io/) application designed to help users create efficient investment portfolios using [Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory). This tool provides a user-friendly interface to construct and visualize the efficient frontier, enabling you to optimize asset allocation for maximum return and minimum risk.

## Overview

This application was inspired by the [Medium post on constructing Markowitz's efficient frontier](https://medium.com/@guilherme.ziegler/constructing-markowitzs-efficient-frontier-with-python-and-streamlit-f99a495fb74d) by Guilherme Ziegler and another [related article](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/coding-markowitzs-efficient-frontier-with-python-and-streamlit-97014e8cb06d). While inspired by these resources, the code and functionalities of this tool were independently developed to provide a unique and tailored experience.
